Example of a Shiny Apps reactive application

---

## Summary
This project uses the famous Kaggle [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to demonstrate interactive machine learning models for survival prediction.
This simple application is deployed on shinyapps.io (link: (https://lucfrachon-ds.shinyapps.io/TitanicLightDataset/)).
Most of the effort was spent on the mechanics rather than cosmetics, and the application could definitely be improved from that perspective.

## How to use it
- Detailed instructions are provided on the application itself
- Choose a machine learning model class from the three available and tune the meta-parameter (it is different for each model and is explained in a box below the slider)
- The accuracy metrics and the plot will be updated reactively.
